// wedding-rsvp

This project is my first ruby-on-rails application, which is thus-far specialized for our wedding.

This project has the following functionality:

Tracking attendance to a wedding ceremony
Tracking attendance to a wedding reception
Verifying the attendees understand what's involved in attending our ceremony [disclaimer]
Getting names of unknown guests //currently broken
Tracking party contact information
Gathering meals for catering planning

Future goals:
Price estimation based on meal selection
Data validation of fields
Other things I can't think of
